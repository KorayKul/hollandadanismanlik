<h2 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2rem;">Why Choose the Netherlands for Your Business?</h2>
<div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
<h3>1. Access to the EU Market</h3>
<p>A business established in the Netherlands can trade freely within the EU. Export becomes easier, and your products and services can reach broader markets.</p>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
<h3>2. Tax Advantages and Financial Incentives</h3>
<p>Corporate tax is 19% for the first €200,000 of profit and 25.8% thereafter (as of 2025). The tax system is transparent, digital, and predictable. Thanks to the double taxation agreement with Turkey, you won't pay tax twice.</p>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
<h3>3. Rights for Migrant Entrepreneurs</h3>
<p>Under the Ankara Agreement, Turkish citizens can start a business and work under specific conditions. If you legally stay and work in the Netherlands for 3 years, you can apply for a long-term residence permit.</p>
<p>You can obtain a residence permit through family reunification, freelance work, or an entrepreneur visa and operate your business.</p>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
<h3>4. Easy Company Formation</h3>
<p>You can establish a BV (private limited) company with as little as €1 capital. Company formation is usually completed within a few days through fast digital registration via the Chamber of Commerce (KvK).</p>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
<h3>5. High Quality of Life and Professional Environment</h3>
<p>The level of English is high, making communication easy. The infrastructure is strong, and the entrepreneurship ecosystem is well developed. The Netherlands also offers tax incentives for startups and tech companies.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>6. Turkish Community and Local Networks</h3>
<p>The Netherlands hosts a large and supportive Turkish community. Trade, consultancy, and networking among Turks are easy and effective.</p>
